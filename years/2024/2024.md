title: "Phylogenetics Seminar"
subtitle: Spring 2024

* Biol 4750/6750
* Time: Wednesdays at 10:30
* Class website: [https://crothfels.github.io/PhyloSeminar/years/2024/2024](https://crothfels.github.io/PhyloSeminar/years/2024/2024)


## Instructors

* Carl Rothfels -- carl.rothfels@usu.edu
* Mike May -- mrmay@berkeley.edu, _in absentia_


## Format

I will lead a series of introductory sessions (lectures) for the first three or four meetings. Subsequent meetings will be student-led. Each student will be responsible for leading a session (potentially in groups, depending on enrollment and interest) on a topic of their choice. That student will be responsible for developing an annotated bibliography of 10 – 20 important papers on the topic, including both “classics” and the most recent works, for selecting two of the papers for the class to read, and for preparing a short (15min) presentation on the topic. The remainder of the session will be devoted to discussion.

Possible topics include: modeling migration/hybridization/introgression (phylogenetic networks); state-dependent diversification models; fossil data (e.g. fossilized-birth-death process/tip dating vs node calibrations); modeling gene duplication and loss; polymorphism-aware (PoMo) models; covarion/hidden state models; model testing (e.g. Bayes factors, AIC); model adequacy (e.g. posterior predictive tests); demographic inference (e.g., inferring population size changes through time); the multispecies coalescent, genetrees/species tree; the BAMM controversy; divergence time dating; inferring selection from sequence alignments; alignment inference (alignment-phylogeny co-inference?); community phylogenetics; spatial phylogenetics; inferring phylogenies from morphological data; heterogeneous models, e.g., non-stationary base frequencies; ancestral state reconstruction; phylogenomics (strengths, pitfalls?); inferring correlated evolution of traits; assessing support; hypothesis testing of relationships; reconstructing morphological evolution on a phylogeny; ABC approaches; hidden Markov models; mixture models; species delimitation; microbial community analysis; quartet-based methods (e.g. SVDquartets); etc; etc. Also more practical topics would make cool sessions, such as "how to use YYYY software", etc. Effectively anything phylogenetics-related would be great; please consult with me prior to picking a topic so that we can make sure that it's manageable, etc.

## Class Slack: 

HTTPS://USUTREETHINKING.SLACK.COM

Slack is a messenger/socialmedia/texting-like application that we’ll use for much of our outside-of-class communication. There's a channel there limited to students (no instructors!), channels for asking questions, etc.

## Course Texts

I have a class set of *Tree Thinking: An Introduction to Phylogenetic Biology* (Baum & Smith 2012); students are also encouraged to consult *Inferring Phylogenies* (Felsenstein 2004) and *Molecular Evolution: A Statistical Approach* (Yang 2014).
